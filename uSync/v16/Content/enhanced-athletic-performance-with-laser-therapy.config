There are papers published concerning the PBM treatment of all types of injuries, from sprains to traumatic brain injuries.\nAthletic competition can be tough on the body.  From golfers to MMA fighters, each require well informed clinicians with the right tools to keep them in the game.  Laser Therapy has become a must in the locker room and on the field.
