While the positive effects of red and near infrared light wavelengths are gaining deeper understanding and better acceptance in dental medicine, the use of other wavelengths like blue light are still being investigated.</p>\n<p>In this webinar, Marina Polonsky, DDS, MSc will explore new applications of blue light in dental medicine, including surface disinfection to aid in post-surgical healing, as well as potential future applications in controlling, reducing, and preventing decay without antibiotics or side effects. Additionally, Dr. Polonsky will revisit the current uses of various light sources in curing composites, soft tissue surgery, and power dental bleaching where the blue light wavelength is emerging as superior to more conventional methods like plasma arc lamps and infrared diodes.</p>\n<p>Key Talking Points:</p>\n<p>-Evolution of various coherent and incoherent BLUE light sources in dentistry and their applications, including curing composites, vital bleaching, surgery, and bactericidal/static topical effect</p>\n<p>-Discuss where BLUE wavelength fits within the concept of photobiomodulation and photo-dynamic therapy</p>\n<p>-Explain the mechanism of antibacterial action of blue wavelength with and without use of photosensitizer and importance of DOSE.</p>\n<p>-Proof of concept for using blue LED or laser as non-pharmaceutical, side effect-free therapy for eliminating dental decay</p>\n<br />"}]]></Value>
