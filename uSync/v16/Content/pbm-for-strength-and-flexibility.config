Inactivity is one of the key reasons that muscles lose their natural suppleness and flexibility and can become prone to tears, aches, and pains. If the situation is not remedied in time, loss of flexibility could lead to permanent changes in posture and normal muscle function.\nIt is therefore imperative to maintain muscle flexibility as an important component of overall fitness. As we age, your muscles naturally lose strength and size and can become less supple and stiffer. Our sedentary lifestyle and work habits are major contributors to loss of ROM and inflexibility.  Trying to regain what you have lost over the years can be a struggle.  Physically inactive people can lose as much as 5% of their muscle mass each decade after age 30. Even if you are active, you\u0027ll still have some muscle loss.\nPBM has a lot to offer towards making this path to less painful and enjoyable and is a game changer for muscle conditioning and restoring function.  Join Dr. Chris Carraway for our July webinar as he discusses PBM for Strength and Flexibility"
