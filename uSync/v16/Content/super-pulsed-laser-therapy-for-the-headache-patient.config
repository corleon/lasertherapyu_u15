  "markup": "Headache disorders are among the most common disorders of the nervous system. It has been estimated that almost half of the adult population have had a headache at least once within the last year.\nHeadache disorders, which are characterized by recurrent headache, are associated with personal and societal burdens of pain, disability, damaged quality of life, and financial cost. Worldwide, a minority of people with headache disorders are diagnosed appropriately by a health-care provider. Headache has been underestimated, under-recognized and under-treated throughout the world.\nHeadache cases can be complicated in nature. We have zero diagnostic tests for the headache complaint. Listening, knowing what questions to ask, and properly interpreting the answers is key to success.\nJoin host Dr. Christopher Carraway and special guest Timothy Demchak, PhD, ATC, as they cover several protocols and some interesting approaches to managing this very common complaint with Super Pulsed Laser Therapy.\nAbout Dr. Demchak: Dr. Demchak is currently a Full Professor at Indiana State University where his research interests include laser therapy treatments for fibromyalgia syndrome. He is also the founder, director and main clinician of Athletic Training Services at Wabash Valley Health Center."
