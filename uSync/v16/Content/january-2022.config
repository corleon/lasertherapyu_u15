      <Value><![CDATA[{"blocks": {"contentData": [], "settingsData": [], "expose": [], "Layout": {}}, "markup": "<p>Essentially a continuum of care system (CoCS) provides a comprehensive range of health services, so that care can evolve with the patient over their entire health span. With the awareness that a patient&rsquo;s health may be most at-risk during breaks in care, the continuum of care exists to ensure those gaps are filled. This covers all phases of illness from diagnosis to the end of life. Laser therapy is a well-suited modality that can provide an extensive array of preventive care, through medical incidents, rehabilitation, and maintenance care options.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In this webinar we are going beyond the patient's chief complaint. We are going beyond becoming faster, stronger, and gaining endurance. There are laser therapy gains for \"healthy\" individuals too. What is the point of a long life if the quality is less than optimal? Could we possibly delay or even avoid some common aging factors? There is a growing collection of scientific papers on the neuroprotective properties with laser therapy. The news media continually tell us that nursing homes are going to be full of Alzheimer's and Dementia patients in the coming decades. Could the regular application of some simple laser protocols change this? Scientists are reporting necessary steps to do just that. Could a handful of PBM protocols keep the elderly more active later into life? Again, the science says yes.</p>\n<p> Join Dr. Christopher Carraway and Douglas Johnson for the January Webinar as we take a new look at the Continuum of Care.<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<br />"}]]></Value>
