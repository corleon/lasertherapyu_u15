It affects a wide range of individuals and often goes undiagnosed, especially in those with anxiety, asthma, or poor postural habits. The physiological impacts include altered oxygen delivery, muscle fatigue, and nervous system disruption, contributing to symptoms like breathlessness, dizziness, and fatigue. </p>\n<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) further complicates respiratory health, with high global prevalence and substantial healthcare costs. Traditional treatments often fail to address muscle dysfunction and cellular stress. Laser therapy, specifically photobiomodulation (PBM), offers a promising adjunct by reducing inflammation, enhancing mitochondrial function, and improving diaphragmatic performance. </p>\n<p>In this webinar, Drs. Christopher Carraway and Timothy Demchak will explore the underlying mechanisms of dysfunctional breathing and COPD, discuss clinical challenges in treatment, and present the science and protocols behind PBM therapy as an emerging tool in respiratory care.</p>\n<p>Key Talking Points:</p>\n<p>- Review the causes of dysfunctional breathing and COPD and their widespread effects on physical and mental health, plus the economic impacts</p>\n<p>- Discuss the research behind using PBM/laser therapy as a supportive treatment to target inflammation and enhance respiratory function</p>\n<p>- Explore real-world cases and develop protocols for using laser therapy as an adjunct to traditional treatments</p>\n<br />"}]]></Value>
